# CSCI346 Assignment4
The Green Room mobile app provides long range surf forecasts for Australiaâ€™s major beaches. Our application fetches forecast data from The Australian Surf Forecast API and displays swell size, swell direction, wind speed, wind direction in 3 hour increments. Users are able to view and bookmark beaches closest to them and seamlessly navigate to their details. Green Room is the most convenient way to find what the surf is doing at locations around you. Making it easier than ever to decide where to surf. Completely Free.
